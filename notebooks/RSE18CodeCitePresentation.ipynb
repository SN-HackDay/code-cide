    "\n",
    "Software is increasingly referenced in publications [1] because it has been used to produce the results being described, and because journals and funders are requiring code to be shared to improve reproducibility, encourage reuse and reduce duplication. This software may have been written to enable the work described in the publication, may be being cited to credit the original authors, or the main function of the publication could be to describe the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "However it is hard both to identify software which is referenced in publications, and to assess its reusability. To address this we mined [2] the full text of papers available from EuropePMC to identify links to software repositories (here, “Github.com”). We investigated link persistence and queried the software repository to extract attributes including license information, documentation and update frequency, from which we inferred the likely reusability and sustainability of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results show that there are clear differences in the reusability of software referenced in the research literature.\n",
