This is a hackday project at Collaboration Workshop 2018 in Cardiff [1]. It builds upon a project started at Springer Nature Hackday [2] in November 2017.

The goal is to analyze a corpus of papers for citation links into repositories which may hold research data and/or software. 
Numbers associated with the prevalence of code and data citations in academic literature shall provide insights into the growing importance of research software and its developers.
The application also indicates measures of stability and quality for this code by resolving links found in papers and evaluating metadata like the existance of a README.me and license file.
Insights may further the much needed culture change regarding the recognition of open data and code sharing in the scientific community. 
This work shall supplement work by Park (2017) [3] an others.

The corpus currently implemented is available from [4] (future work includes plans to make other corpuses available to this tool.)

Licensing information and citation suggestions can be found in the project's GitHub repo [5]
